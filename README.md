# TicTacToe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. The game is played on the command line and allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
